Snowman Project Report in Computer Graphics
Abstract

The Snowman Project is an educational initiative designed to illustrate the principles of computer graphics through the creation of a 3D snowman model. Utilizing a graphics programming framework, this project demonstrates basic shapes, transformations, and rendering techniques. By developing this project, we gain hands-on experience in 3D modeling and graphical representation, enhancing our understanding of computer graphics concepts.
Introduction

Computer graphics is a vital field in computer science that focuses on generating visual content using computers. The Snowman Project serves as a practical application of these concepts, allowing participants to create a simple yet engaging 3D model. The project encompasses the creation of basic geometric shapes, their transformations, and rendering techniques, which are foundational skills in graphics programming. The objective is to develop a snowman model while learning the fundamentals of 3D graphics.

Source Code

Here is a simplified version of the source code for creating a basic snowman using OpenGL in Python:

python

import OpenGL.GL as gl
import OpenGL.GLUT as glut
import numpy as np

def draw_sphere(radius, slices, stacks):
    gluSphere(gluNewQuadric(), radius, slices, stacks)

def draw_snowman():
    # Base
    glPushMatrix()
    glTranslatef(0.0, -1.5, 0.0)
    glColor3f(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)  # White color
    draw_sphere(1.0, 20, 20)
    glPopMatrix()

    # Middle
    glPushMatrix()
    glTranslatef(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    draw_sphere(0.75, 20, 20)
    glPopMatrix()

    # Head
    glPushMatrix()
    glTranslatef(0.0, 1.25, 0.0)
    draw_sphere(0.5, 20, 20)
    glPopMatrix()

def display():
    glClear(gl.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
    glLoadIdentity()
    draw_snowman()
    glutSwapBuffers()

def main():
    glutInit()
    glutInitDisplayMode(glut.GLUT_DOUBLE | glut.GLUT_RGB)
    glutInitWindowSize(800, 600)
    glutCreateWindow(b'Snowman Project')
    glutDisplayFunc(display)
    glutMainLoop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Result

Upon executing the code, the application displays a 3D snowman model composed of three spheres representing the base, middle, and head. The snowman's appearance is rendered in a white color, showcasing basic 3D rendering capabilities. The model can be manipulated by adjusting camera angles and transformations to visualize the snowman from different perspectives.
Conclusion

The Snowman Project effectively demonstrates the core concepts of computer graphics, including 3D modeling, transformations, and rendering techniques. Through the hands-on development of a snowman model, participants gain valuable insights into the graphical programming process. This project serves as a foundation for further exploration of more complex graphical applications and enhances understanding of computer graphics principles. Future improvements could include adding textures, lighting effects, and interactivity to enhance the user experience.
